    Utility Module for building tests that reliably check if a
    sub-process ran successfully.

    Commonly with an integration/system test you want to check
    a command can be run successfully and gives some expected
    output.

    How to use:
    1. Make a test case in the normal way but inherit from
    test_util.SubProcessChecker instead of unitteset.TestCase.
    2. Define a test method in your derived class in the normal way.
    3. Have the test method call self.run_command(...) and the output
    will be checked automatically.
